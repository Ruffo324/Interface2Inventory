# Important
I am not the official author of this script. 
The scripts **"makelist"** and **"I2I"** are based on this [Source](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/24612-applied-energistics-item-exporter/). So the idea, and the base script comes from the author **[zacherl1990](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/user/18374-zacherl1990/)**.

# Usage
## 1. makelist
To quickly and easily create a configuration file for I2I, there is the **"makelist"** command.
